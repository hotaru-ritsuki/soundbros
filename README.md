# SafeSound Engine Analysis

Hi! If you're here, you're interested in my project. Or you want to hire me. Or both things together)

This project developed to find engine malfunctions in the early stages using only the sound of your engine. It uses FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze the sound.

I want you to join my team, so:
1. PM me t.me/hotaru-ritsuki, or
2. Create your pull request

Good Luck!
